`lib.py` is a function library that contains most of the functions required for calculations.  
`potentials.py` is used to define potential energy functions for testing.  
Run `adiabatic_boundary_scattering.py` to obtain the results corresponding to Fig. 3c in the paper.  
Run `LB_transport.py` to generate the data needed for Fig. 5b in the paper; the output is saved in `.pkl` format.  
The `plot_transport.py` script can be used to plot the `.pkl` data and reproduce Fig. 5b.
